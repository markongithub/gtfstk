Changes
=========

9.3.2, 2018-09-14
------------------
- Fixed `Issue 10 <https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfstk/issues/10>`_
- Fixed some deprecation warnings


9.3.1, 2018-08-24
-----------------
- Bugfixed validators with `Pull Request 8 <https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfstk/pull/8>`_.


9.3.0, 2018-08-01
------------------
- Replaced ``count_active_trips`` with cjer's faster ``get_active_trips_df``, yielding a ~6x speed up on ``compute_route_stats``.
- Autoformated code with Black.
- Added ``restrict_to_dates``.
- Dropped support for Python < 3.6.


9.2.3, 2018-05-25
------------------
- Bugfixed ``geometrize_stops`` which was putting some NaNs in the geometry column.


9.2.2, 2018-05-24
------------------
- Added trip direction arrows to maps produced by ``map_trips``.


9.2.1, 2018-05-24
------------------
- Fixed bug HTML-escaping apostrophes in ``make_html``.


9.2.0, 2018-05-23
------------------
- Added ``map_trips`` which works like ``map_routes``.


9.1.0, 2018-05-02
------------------
- Changed ``route_to_geojson`` to return LineStrings instead of a MultiLineString and added a date keyword argurment.
- Changed ``shapes_to_geojson`` to accept an optional list of shape IDs to restrict to.
- Added ``map_routes`` function to draw routes and their stops on a Folium map, if Folium is installed.
- Inserted stars in function signatures to separate boolean keyword arguments. Is this a breaking change? I say no, but it's debatable.
- Changed ``compute_trip_stats`` to accept an optional list of route IDs to restrict to.
- Clarified the doctstrings of ``compute_route_stats`` and ``compute_route_time_series`` to note that those functions can accept slices of trip stats.
- Changed ``compute_stop_stats`` and ``compute_stop_time_series`` to accept an optional list of stop IDs.


9.0.3, 2018-03-21
------------------
- Stopped ``drop_zombies`` from dropping stops with location type 1 or 2.
- Changed ``CRS_WGS84`` to ``WGS84`` and removed the ``no_defs`` key to agree with GeoPandas's WGS84 CRS.
- Replaced some ``None`` outputs with empty dictionary outputs where appropriate, e.g. in ``build_shape_by_geometry``.


9.0.2, 2017-07-12
-------------------
- Bugfixed the ``get_dates()`` function. It was throwing an error when the calendar or calendar_dates table was empty.


9.0.1, 2017-07-06
-------------------
- Bugfixed the stats and time series functions. They were throwing errors in the edge case where all the given dates had no active trips.
- Bugfixed ``combine_time_series()``. Its direction ID column names were ``'0'`` and ``'1'`` but should be ``0`` and ``1``.


9.0.0, 2017-07-04
-------------------
- Added informative printing for Feeds.
- Removed the ``time_it`` decorator in favor of IPython's ``%time`` magic .
- Inspired by the `Transitland Dispatcher <https://transit.land/dispatcher/feed-versions/eb0cbe5ab41c9cfde0ebae42471ab5b3f712b008>`_, added the ``summarize`` function and the ``list_gtfs`` function.
- Extended several functions to accept date lists, a breaking change for the outputs of those functions. For example, now you can compute feed stats for the entire feed period more easily and quickly (by memoizing active trip IDs) than computing the stats separately for each date.
- By popular demand, redefined the ``num_trips`` indicator in route and feed time series to be the number of unique trips active in a time bin instead of the time weighted average thereof.
- Removed columns from empty DataFrames returned by ``compute_route_stats`` etc.
- Elaborated docstrings.


8.0.2, 2017-05-09
-------------------
- Updated the installation requirements in ``setup.py``.


8.0.1, 2017-04-26
-------------------
- Fixed the bug where ``setup.py`` could not find the license file.


8.0.0, 2017-04-21
-----------------
- Finally knuckled down and wrote a GTFS validator: ``validators.py``.  It's basic, easy to read, and, thanks to Pandas, fast.  It checks `this 31 MB Southeast Queensland feed <http://transitfeeds.com/p/translink/21/20170310>`_ in 22 seconds on my 2.8-GHz-processor-16-GB-memory computer.  With the same computer and feed and in fast mode (``--memory_db``), `Google's GTFS validator <https://github.com/google/transitfeed>`_ takes 420 seconds. That's about 19 times slower. Part of the latter validator's slowness is its many checks beyond the GTFS, such as checks for too fast travel between every pair of stop times.
- Moved all but the most basic ``Feed`` methods into other modules grouped by theme, ``routes.py``, ``stops.py``, etc.  Eases reading and additionally exposes the methods as functions on feeds, like in the GTFSTK versions before 7.0.0.
- Speeded up ``asssess_quality``.
- Refactored ``constants.py``.
- Renamed some functions.


7.0.0, 2017-04-07
-----------------
- Rewrote most feed functions as ``Feed`` methods.
- Rewrote tests for pytest.
- Removed some miscellaneous functions, such as plotting functions.


6.1.0, 2016-11-24
-----------------
- Changed ``feed.read_gtfs`` to unzip to temporary directory.
- Enabled ``feed.write_gtfs`` to write to a directory.


6.0.0, 2016-10-17
-----------------
- Improved function names, e.g. ``compute_trips_stats`` -> ``compute_trip_stats``.
- Added functions to ``cleaner.py`` and changed cleaning function outputs to feed instances.
- Made ``feed.copy`` a method.
- Simplified Feed objects and added auto-updates to secondary attributes.
- Changed the signatures of a few functions, e.g. ``calculator.append_dist_to_shapes`` now returns a feed instead of a shapes data frame.
- Fixed formatting of properties field in ``calculator.trip_to_geojson`` and ``calculator.route_to_geojson``.


5.1.1, 2016-09-01
-----------------
- Bugfix: Added ``'from_stop_id'`` and ``'to_stop_id'`` to list of string data types in ``constants.py``. Previously, they were sometimes getting interpreted as floats, which stripped leading zeros from the IDs, which then did not match the IDs in the stops data frame.


5.1.0, 2016-08-31
-----------------
- Added trip ID parameter to ``calculator.get_stops``.
- Created ``calculator.trip_to_geojson``.
- Added whitespace stripping to ``cleaner.clean_route_short_names``.


5.0.0, 2016-07-08
-----------------
- Renamed the function ``calculator.get_feed_intersecting_polygon`` to ``calculator.restrict_by_polygon``.
- Added the function ``calculator.restrict_by_routes``.


4.3.0, 2016-07-04
-----------------
- Added the function ``calculator.get_start_and_end_times``.


4.2.0, 2016-07-04
-----------------
- Added the functions ``calculator.compute_center``, ``calculator. compute_bounds``, ``calculator.route_to_geojson``.
- Extended the function ``calculator.get_stops`` to accept an optional route ID.
- Extended the function ``calculator.build_geometry_by_shape`` to accept and optional set of shape IDs.
- Extended the function ``calculator.build_geometry_by_stop`` to accept and optional set of stop IDs.


4.1.2, 2016-07-01
------------------
- Improved distance sanity checks in ``calculator.compute_trip_stats`` and ``calculator.append_dist_to_stop_times``.


4.1.1, 2016-07-01
------------------
- Bugfixed ``feed.copy`` so that the ``dist_units_in`` of the copy equals ``dist_units_out`` of the original.
- Added some more distance sanity checks to ``calculator.compute_trip_stats`` and ``calculator.append_dist_to_stop_times``.


4.1.0, 2016-05-23
------------------
- Improved ``cleaner.clean_route_short_names``.
- Removed ``utilities.clean_series``.
- Improved ``cleaner.aggregate_routes``.
- Removed some unnecessary print statements.


4.0.0, 2016-05-11
------------------
- Deleted an extraneous print statement in ``calculator.create_shapes``.
- Added ``utilities.is_not_null``.
- Changed ``calculator.shapes_to_geojson`` to return a dictionary instead of a string.
- Upgraded to Pandas 0.18.1 and fixed ``calculator.downsample`` accordingly
- Added ``cleaner.aggregate_routes``.


3.0.1, 2015-12-16
------------------
- Bugfix: formatted ``parent_station`` as a string in ``constants.DTYPE``.


3.0.0, 2015-12-15
------------------
- Changed signature and behavior of ``create_shapes``.
- Added duplicate route short name count to ``assess``.
- Changed the behavior of ``clean_route_short_names``.
- Changed ``INT_COLS`` to ``INT_COLUMNS``.
- Moved some functions.
- Added some functions, such as a function to copy feeds.


2.1, 2015-12-08
------------------
- Added more functions to ``calculator.py``, some of which are optional and depend on GeoPandas.
- Documented more.
- Made ``read_gtfs`` raise a more helpful error when an input path does not exist.


2.0.1, 2015-11-19
--------------------
- Made Matplotlib import optional.
- Updated plotter function chart colors.


2.0.0, 2015-11-06
-------------------
- Moved the ``Feed`` class into a separate file.
- Fixed a fatal bug in ``plot_routes_time_series`` and renamed it ``plot_feed_time_series``.
- Added ``route_type`` to trips stats and routes stats.
- Added more functions to the ``cleaner`` module.


1.0.0, 2015-11-04
--------------------
- Modularized more
- Refactored the Feed class, exporting most methods to functions.
- Changed function names, favoring a ``compute_`` prefix over a ``get_`` prefix for complex functions.
- Bug fix: in ``INT_COLUMNS`` changed ``'dropoff_type'`` to ``'drop_off_type'``.


0.12.3, 2015-07-18
--------------------
- Changed to return empty data frames instead of ``None`` where appropriate
- Added ``Feed.clean_route_short_names``.

--------------------
- Changed name to ``gtfstk``.


0.12.1, 2015-06-24
--------------------
- Added ``route_short_name`` and ``min_headway`` to trips stats and routes stats.
- Changed the default handling of distance units in ``Feed``.


0.12.0, 2015-04-21
--------------------
- Assembled ``feed.py`` and ``utils.py`` into a unified top-level package by tweaking ``__init__.py``.
- Renamed ``get_linestring_by_shape`` and ``get_point_by_stop`` to ``get_geometry_by_shape`` and ``get_geometry_by_stop``, respectively.


0.11.16, 2015-04-20
---------------------
- Added ``min_transfer_time`` to ``INT_COLUMNS``.


0.11.15, 2015-04-14
---------------------
- Fixed ``get_route_timetable`` sort order.


0.11.14, 2015-04-14
---------------------
- Added data frame empty checks to ``Feed.__init__``, because i was getting errors on feeds with empty ``calendar.txt`` files.


0.11.13, 2015-04-14
---------------------
- Removed ``parent_station`` from ``INT_COLUMNS``, which should have never been there in the first place.


0.11.12, 2015-04-13
---------------------
- Now you can specify the output distance units.


0.11.11, 2015-04-08
---------------------
- Changed most functions to return an empty data frame instead of ``None``.

0.11.10, 2015-04-03
---------------------
- Reduced columns in ``get_trips_activity``.
- Added ``clean_series``.


0.11.9, 2015-04-03
---------------------

0.11.8, 2015-03-27
---------------------
- Fixed a bug in the computation of the ``peak_start_time`` and ``peak_end_time`` columns of routes stats and feed stats.


0.11.7, 2015-03-27
---------------------
- Added more columns to ``get_routes_stats``.
- Added ``get_feed_stats`` and ``get_feed_time_series`` and removed the similar ``agg_routes_stats`` and ``agg_routes_time_series``.
- Removed ``dump_all_stats``, because it wasn't very useful.
- Replaced ``get_busiest_date_of_first_week`` with ``get_busiest_date``.


0.11.6, 2015-03-16
---------------------
- Cleaned code slightly.
- Added 'speed' column in trips stats.

0.11.5, 2015-03-13
---------------------
- Added route and stop timetable methods.
- Improved tests slightly.
- Tidied code slightly.
- Change occurrences of 'vehicle' to 'trips', because that's clearer.
- Updated some packages.


0.11.4, 2015-03-12
---------------------
- Changed name to gtfs-tk.


0.11.3, 2015-03-02
----------------------
- Add ``get_shapes_geojson``.
- Renamed ``get_active_trips`` and ``get_active_stops`` to ``get_trips`` and ``get_stops``.
- Upgraded to Pandas 0.15.2.


0.11.2, 2014-12-10
----------------------
- Scooped out main logic from ``Feed.get_stops_stats`` and ``Feed.get_stops_time_series`` and put it into top level functions for the sake of greater flexibility.  Similar to what i did for ``Feed.get_routes_stats`` and ``Feed.get_routes_time_series``.
- Fixed a bug in computing the last stop of each trip in ``get_trips_stats``.
- Improved the accuracy of trip distances in ``get_trips_stats``.
- Upgraded to Pandas 0.15.1.


0.11.1, 2014-11-12
----------------------
- Added ``fill_nan_route_short_names``.
- Switched back to version numbering in the style of major.minor.micro, because that seems more useful.


0.11, 2014-11-10
----------------------
- Fixed a bug in ``Feed.get_routes_stats`` that modified the input data frame and therefore affected the same data frame outside of the function (dumb Pandas gotcha). Changed it to operate on a copy of the data frame instead.


0.10, 2014-11-06
----------------------
- Speeded up time series computations by at least a factor of 10.
- Switched from representing dates as ``datetime.date`` objects to '%Y%m%d' strings (the GTFS way of representing dates), because that's simpler and faster. Added an export method to feed objects.
- Minor tweaks to ``append_dist_to_stop_times``.


0.9, 2014-10-29
----------------------
- Scooped out main logic from ``Feed.get_routes_stats`` and ``Feed.get_routes_time_series`` and put it into top level functions for the sake of greater flexibility.  I at least need that flexibility to plug into another project.


0.8, 2014-10-24
----------------------
- Simplified methods to accept a single date instead of a list of dates.


0.7, 2014-10-08
----------------------
- Whoops, lost track of the changes for this version.

0.5, 2014-10-02
----------------------
- Converted headways to minutes
- Added option to change headway start and end time cutoffs in ``get_stops_stats`` and ``get_stations_stats``

----------------------
- Changed ``get_xy_by_stop`` name and output type.


0.2.1, 2014-07-22
